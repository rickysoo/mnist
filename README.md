# MNIST Handwritten Digit Classifiers

Given a collection of images of handwritten digit, train a number of classifiers:
- To identify the number (mnist_digit.ipynb)
- To identify whether the number is odd or even (mnist_odd.ipynb)
- To identify the number from the images cropped in half (mnist_crop.ipynb)
