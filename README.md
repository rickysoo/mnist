# MNIST Handwritten Digit Classifiers

Given a collection of images of handwritten digit, train a number of classifiers:
- To identify the number (mnist_digit.ipynb)
- To identify whether the number is odd or even (mnist_odd.ipynb)
- To identify the number from the images cropped in half in the middle (mnist_crop_middle.ipynb)
- To identify the number from the images cropped in half randomly (mnist_crop_random.ipynb)
